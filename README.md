# Bagel Apocalypse

This is a game developed for PirateSoftware Game Jam 14! The theme is "It's Spreading!" Below are ideas and a 
breakdown of possible functionality! Everything is being streamed live on Twitch at https://twitch.tv/cameronadams777

## Ideas

- Office space setting
- CEO turns into Bagel
- Make your way to the mail room while everyone is turning into Bagels
- Protect yourself with spreading tool?
- Avoid other bagels and cream cheese along the way
    - Cream cheese is infected (I'm lactose intolerant)
- Start on what you think is a high floor and work your way down?
    - Could go from bottom up for evac on roof?

## GamePlay

- Start with 3 lives
- Round based
- Procedurally generate floor
- Find your way to next set of stairs
- Pickup tools/weapons along the way
    - Something should be left behind each round?
- NPCs on each floor that change to Bagels (randomly?)
- Cream cheese slows you down
- Potentially have some sort of screen visibility power down
- If bagel touches you, reduce life count and reset to spawn point on same floor

### Tools

- Toaster Oven
    - Works like a fire flower from mario where you can shoot fire at bagels
- Spreading tool
    - Prevents you from losing a life when touched and removes the bagel that you touched

### Power-Up/Downs

#### Cream cheese - Down

- Consume and reduce for short period of time

#### Salmon - Up

- Nullify cream cheese slowdown
- Speeds up for a time

#### Butter - Down

- Smears screen so that we can't see
